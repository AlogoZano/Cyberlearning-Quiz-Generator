# Cyberlearning-Quiz-Generator
Intelligent quiz generation using the OpenAI API and creating an automatic forms via the Google forms API. This project has the goal of reaching physics professors who would like to optimize their content quiz creation.

## General requirements
* Access to Google cloud platform
* Credentials for Google forms API
* Acces to OpenAI API or JSON responses
* Python knowledge


## Forms example
View here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfvnwpZ3J2ciUHQFhA_ofCggJUlNp2XDrT1Wt2NlWiVFQHGRw/viewform (via forms_tiro_parab.py)

## Future improvements
* Closed loop generation. Generate a model which automatically creates the response and forms, in one query.
* Response checker. Another model in charge of checking generated answers
* Give feedback for incorrect answers based on miscalculations (for practical problems).
